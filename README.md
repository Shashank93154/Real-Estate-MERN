# Real Estate Application (MERN Stack)

## Overview

This project is a *Real Estate Application* built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users to browse, search, and manage real estate listings, view detailed property information, and contact property agents. The project showcases a full-stack web application with RESTful API integration, user authentication, and responsive UI.

### Key Features

- *User Authentication:* Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles using JWT-based authentication.
- *Property Listings:* Browse and search for real estate properties by location, price, and type (e.g., apartment, house, commercial).
- *Detailed View:* Each listing includes images, descriptions, and contact details for the property agent.
- *Favorites & Wishlist:* Users can save properties they like to a wishlist for future reference.
- *Admin Dashboard:* Admin users can manage property listings (CRUD operations), monitor user activity, and track inquiries.
- *Responsive Design:* The application is fully responsive and works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- *Frontend:*
  - React.js for UI components and state management (with Hooks & Context API)
  - Redux (optional) for more complex state management needs
  - Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend API
  - React Router for seamless navigation between pages
  - TailwindCSS for styling the components
  - Formik and Yup for handling forms and validation
  
- *Backend:*
  - Node.js with Express.js for building the API
  - MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage and schema modeling
  - JWT for user authentication and session management
  - Multer for handling file uploads (property images)
  
- *Database:*
  - MongoDB for storing user data, property listings, and inquiries
  
- *API:*
  - RESTful API for fetching property data, managing user sessions, and performing CRUD operations on property listings
  
- *Deployment:*
  - Deployed on [Heroku, Vercel, Netlify, etc.]
  - MongoDB Atlas for database hosting
